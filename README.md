# Uncommon TypeError in List Comprehension with Dictionaries

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to TypeErrors when working with list comprehensions and dictionaries in Python. The code attempts to extract values from dictionaries in a list, but it fails gracefully when encountering a non-dictionary element.

## The Bug
The bug arises because the list comprehension assumes that all elements in the input list are dictionaries. If a non-dictionary element is present, accessing the 'value' key will result in a `TypeError`. This code demonstrates that error handling is essential.
